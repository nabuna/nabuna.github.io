                    <p><strong>Spotify Wrapped 2021 (2021/12/05)</strong></p>
                    <p>This year's wrapped is again stucked with japanese music... (unexpected). Surprisingly though, Yorushika is still on top, I thought I didn't hear them as much this year...? Anyways, I only use Spotify when I'm out, so this list kind of not represents much. To point something out, I've known about Chatmonchy from just this year, and I've really been loving their music lately.</p>

                    <p>Already beat the game... Had a much better experience than I expected. I can feel there is love put into this game, so props to ILCA and the rest of the developers. <br>It's now time for the after-game!</p>

                    <p>Finally this game came out! It actually feels quite good to play it, even though I didn't expect much from the trailers... I am, indeed, enjoying it a lot.</p>
